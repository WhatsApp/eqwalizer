%% This type is intended to help with code being transitioned
%% from untyped/unchecked mode to gradual mode.
%% Values of dynamic types slip through
%% the fingers of eqWAlizer in GRADUAL mode.
%% dynamic() is a special type which is a subtype and a supertype of all types.
%% It is defined as an alias to term() to be friendly
%% for other tooling (as dialyzer).
%% In strict mode dynamic() is treated by eqWAlizer as an alias to term().
-type dynamic() :: term().

%% This type is a more precise version of dynamic/0, that introduces
%% some degree of soundness while retaining the flexibility of dynamic/0.
%% dynamic(T) is a subtype of everything, but a supertype of T
%% (and its subtypes) only.
%% It behaves as "T in, dynamic() out".
%% For other tooling, dynamic(T) is defined as an alias to T.
-type dynamic(T) :: T.

%% @doc

%% @doc
%% A utility function for helping debug type-related errors.
%% You can use eqwalizer:reveal_type(Expr) to ask eqWAlizer to display
%% the inferred static type of an expression.
%% This can be useful when you don't quite understand how
%% eqWAlizer handles a particular piece of code.

%% This type can be used in a record type declaration to specify
%% that the type of a field can be further refined.
%% For example, -record(rec, {id :: eqwalizer:refinable(term()), id2 :: string()})
%% creates a record type rec where the field id can be refined later, by
%% writing for example #rec{id :: atom()} in a spec.
%% While this is not mandatory, using this type will make the type-checker
%% smarter about refined record types.
-type refinable(A) :: A.
